- **Setup/Teardown Methods** üîß (January 2025)
  - Full support for all pytest setup/teardown methods
  - Module level: `setup_module()` and `teardown_module()`

### Fixed
- **Parametrized Test Value Mapping** ‚ö° (January 2025)
  - Fixed critical bug where parametrized tests received indices instead of actual values
  - Tests now receive correct parameter values from `@pytest.mark.parametrize`
  - Complex parameter types (lists, dicts, None) are properly passed to test functions
