### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. **Parser System**
- **Regex Parser**: Fast pattern matching for simple cases
- **AST Parser**: Accurate parsing using tree-sitter (default)
- **Type-safe Selection**: ParserType enum for compile-time safety

#### 2. **Discovery Caching**
- Content-based invalidation using file hashes
- Persistent cache in `~/.cache/fastest/`
- Cache statistics tracking
- 50x+ speedup on warm cache

#### 3. **Execution Strategies**
- **BatchExecutor**: Groups tests by module
- **ParallelExecutor**: Multi-process with work stealing
- **OptimizedExecutor**: Intelligent batching and pre-filtering
- **PersistentWorkerPool**: Reuses Python processes (experimental)

#### 4. **Test Organization**
- Parametrized test expansion
- Fixture dependency resolution
- Marker-based filtering
- Skip/xfail handling

#### 5. **Configuration**
- Multi-source config loading (pyproject.toml, pytest.ini, etc.)
- Fastest-specific options
- Pattern-based test discovery
- CLI argument override

#### 6. **Reporting**
- **PrettyReporter**: Colored output with progress bars
- **JsonReporter**: Machine-readable output
- **JunitReporter**: CI/CD integration

#### 7. **Incremental Testing**
- Dependency tracking via import analysis
- Affected test detection
- Persistent dependency cache

#### 8. **Plugin System**
- Hook-based architecture similar to pytest
- Built-in plugins (markers, timeout, capture)
- Extensible for third-party plugins

#### 9. **Watch Mode**
- File system monitoring with notify
- Intelligent test re-running
- Dependency-aware updates

## Performance Optimizations

### Discovery Optimizations
- Parallel file traversal
- Tree-sitter for fast AST parsing
- Lazy test loading
- Efficient caching

### Execution Optimizations
- Process pool reuse
- Batch test execution
- Skip test pre-filtering
- Optimized Python code generation
- Work-stealing parallelism

### Memory Optimizations
- Streaming result processing
- Efficient data structures (DashMap)
- Controlled batch sizes
- Resource pooling

## Compatibility

### Supported pytest Features
- ✅ Test discovery patterns
- ✅ Basic fixtures (function, module scope)
- ✅ Markers (skip, xfail, parametrize)
- ✅ Test classes
- ✅ Async tests
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Basic assertions

### Limitations
- ❌ Complex fixture scoping (session, package)
- ❌ Plugin compatibility (pytest plugins won't work)
- ❌ Some assertion introspection
- ❌ Coverage integration
- ❌ Doctests

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic usage
fastest tests/

# With configuration
fastest --workers 8 --optimizer optimized tests/

# Watch mode
fastest --watch tests/

# Incremental testing
fastest --incremental tests/

# Different output formats
fastest --output json tests/
fastest --output junit --junit-xml results.xml tests/

# Marker filtering
fastest -m "not slow" tests/

# Pattern filtering
fastest -k "test_important" tests/
```

## Future Work

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Coverage Integration**: Add pytest-cov compatible coverage support
2. **Better Assertions**: Enhanced diff output and error messages
3. **IDE Integration**: LSP server for test discovery

### Long-term Goals
1. **Distributed Testing**: Run tests across multiple machines
2. **Smart Scheduling**: ML-based test prioritization
3. **Native Assertions**: Rust implementation of common assertions
4. **Profile-Guided Optimization**: Auto-tuning based on history
