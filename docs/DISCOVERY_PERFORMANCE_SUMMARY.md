## ðŸŽ¯ Comparison with Pytest

### Discovery Time Analysis

**Pytest Discovery Time:**
- Small suites (â‰¤100 tests): ~0.12-0.15s
- Large suites (>500 tests): ~0.28s+
- Scales roughly linearly with test count

**Fastest Discovery Time:**
- Small suites (â‰¤100 tests): ~0.011s (constant)
- Large suites (>500 tests): ~0.013-0.099s
- **Sub-linear scaling** - minimal increase with test count
