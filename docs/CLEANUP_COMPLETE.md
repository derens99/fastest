# Cleanup Summary

## What Was Cleaned

### 1. **Consolidated Documentation**
- Moved all development progress files to `docs/development/`:
  - PHASE_PROGRESS.md
  - PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md 
  - PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
  - CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md
  - FINAL_PROGRESS.md
  - NEXT_STEPS.md
  - NEXT_STEPS_PHASE2.md
  - REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
  - TREE_SITTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Moved FASTEST_MARKERS.md to `docs/`
- Created `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` for clear project organization

### 2. **Fixed Rust Warnings**
- Fixed unused variable warnings in:
  - `config/mod.rs` - Added underscore prefix to unused parameters
  - `fixtures/mod.rs` - Added underscore prefix to unused parameters
- Fixed dead code warnings:
  - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to structs in `process_pool.rs`
  - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to FixtureManager
- Removed unused static `PYTHON_TEST_QUERY` from `ast.rs`
- Removed unused `once_cell` import

### 3. **Cleaned Python Cache**
- Removed all `__pycache__` directories
- Verified no `.pyc`, `.pyo`, or other Python artifacts

### 4. **Build Verification**
- Successfully built with `cargo build --release` (no warnings)
- Built Python package with `maturin build`
- Verified CLI functionality
- Confirmed marker filtering still works

## Current State

The codebase is now:
- ✅ Well-organized with clear directory structure
- ✅ Free of compiler warnings
- ✅ Properly documented
- ✅ Fully functional with all features intact
