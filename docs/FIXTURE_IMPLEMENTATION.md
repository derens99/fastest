# Fixture System Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Parser Support
- Extended both regex and AST parsers to recognize `@pytest.fixture` and `@fastest.fixture` decorators
- Added `FixtureDefinition` struct to capture fixture metadata (scope, autouse, params)
- Parser extracts fixture dependencies from test function parameters

### 2. Discovery Integration
- `discover_tests_and_fixtures()` returns both tests and fixtures
- Test items now include `fixture_deps` field listing required fixtures
- Fixture dependency extraction handles type annotations and filters special fixtures

### 3. Python API
- Added `fastest.fixture` decorator in `fastest.py` module
- Supports both `@fixture` and `@fixture(scope="...")` syntax
- Compatible with pytest fixture decorators

### 4. CLI Support
- Verbose mode (`-v`) displays fixture dependencies for each test
- Clear visual indication of which fixtures each test requires

### 5. Core Infrastructure
- `FixtureManager` class for fixture lifecycle management
- Dependency resolution with topological sorting
- Scope-based caching structure (function/class/module/session)

## Example Usage

```python
import fastest

@fastest.fixture
def sample_data():
    return {"value": 42}

def test_with_fixture(sample_data):
    assert sample_data["value"] == 42
```

## Next Steps
- Implement actual fixture execution in test runners
- Add Python bridge for fixture function calls
- Support built-in fixtures (tmp_path, capsys, etc.)
