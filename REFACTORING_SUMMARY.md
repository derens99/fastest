# Executor Module Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the execution-related code in `fastest-core` from a scattered, confusingly-named structure to a clean, organized module hierarchy.

## What Changed

### Before (Messy Structure)
```
src/
├── execution.rs          # Single test execution with subprocess
├── execution_v2.rs       # BatchExecutor and ProcessPool (confusing name)
├── batch_execution.rs    # Helper functions for batch execution  
├── runner.rs            # TestRunner with duplicate parallel implementation
└── executor/
    └── parallel.rs      # ParallelExecutor using rayon
```

### After (Clean Structure)
```
src/
└── executor/
    ├── mod.rs           # Public API and common types (TestResult)
    ├── single.rs        # Single test execution
    ├── batch.rs         # Batch execution (multiple tests, single process)
    ├── parallel.rs      # Parallel execution using rayon
    └── process_pool.rs  # Process pool implementation
```

## Benefits

1. **Logical Organization**: All execution logic is now in one place (`executor/`)
2. **Clear Naming**: Each module name clearly describes its purpose
3. **Hierarchy**: Easy to understand execution levels: single → batch → parallel
4. **No More v2**: Removed confusing `execution_v2` naming
5. **Single Source of Truth**: Removed duplicate parallel implementation from `runner.rs`

## Key Changes Made

1. **Moved TestResult** to `executor/mod.rs` as a common type
2. **Created `single.rs`** from `execution.rs` - handles individual test execution
3. **Created `batch.rs`** from `execution_v2.rs` - BatchExecutor for efficient module-level execution
4. **Kept `parallel.rs`** - ParallelExecutor using rayon for work-stealing parallelism
5. **Created `process_pool.rs`** from `execution_v2.rs` - ProcessPool for future use
6. **Updated all imports** throughout the codebase
7. **Removed legacy files** and exports

## Testing

All functionality verified working:
- ✅ CLI builds successfully
- ✅ Python bindings build successfully  
- ✅ Sequential test execution works
- ✅ Parallel test execution works
- ✅ All existing features maintained

## Future Improvements

1. Consider removing `process_pool.rs` if not needed (currently unused)
2. Add more documentation to each executor module
3. Consider creating an `Executor` trait that all executors implement
4. Add benchmarks comparing different execution strategies
