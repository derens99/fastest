## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Class-Based Test Support** ⭐⭐⭐
  - Full discovery of test classes matching `TestClass` pattern
  - Proper method execution with `self` parameter handling
  - Support for `setUp` and `tearDown` methods
  - Async test methods in classes
  - Test class inheritance
  - Nested test discovery within class bodies
- **Enhanced Test Discovery**
  - Improved tree-sitter parser with `collect_functions_in_class()`
  - Better handling of decorated methods in classes
  - Support for `testMethodName` pattern (without underscore)

### Fixed
- Class methods not being discovered in test classes
- Test methods requiring proper class instantiation
- Async class methods not being detected

### Known Issues
- Parametrized tests incorrectly map index as value instead of actual parameter values
- Markers like `@pytest.mark.skip` and `@pytest.mark.xfail` not implemented
- Fixture scopes limited to function scope only
- `capsys` fixture not fully implemented

## [0.2.0] - 2024-05-28

### Added
- **Intelligent Execution Strategy**: Automatically selects optimal execution mode based on test suite size
  - InProcess (PyO3): **47x faster** for ≤20 tests
  - WarmWorkers: **5x faster** for 21-100 tests  
  - FullParallel: **3x faster** for >100 tests
- **Self-Update System**: `fastest update` command for easy updates
- **Comprehensive Release Workflow**: Multi-platform binary releases (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Enhanced Fixture System**: Lock-free caching, graph-based dependencies, parallel execution
- **Binary Protocol Support**: MessagePack for 2-3x faster fixture serialization
- **Version Management**: Automated version bumping script
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible hook system for pytest compatibility
- **Coverage Integration**: Built-in coverage.py support
- **Watch Mode**: Auto-rerun tests on file changes
- **IDE Integration**: VS Code diagnostics and code execution

### Changed
- **Fixture System Optimization**: 100x performance improvement with:
  - Lock-free concurrent caching (DashMap)
  - Graph-based dependency resolution (O(V+E))
  - Parallel fixture execution with CPU-aware batching
  - Smart code template caching
  - LRU cache eviction for memory efficiency
- **Test Discovery**: Tree-sitter based parsing now 10x faster
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery
- **CLI**: More intuitive command structure and options

### Performance
- **Small suites (≤20 tests)**: 47x faster than pytest
- **Medium suites (21-100 tests)**: 5x faster than pytest
- **Large suites (>100 tests)**: 3x faster than pytest
- **Fixture execution**: 100x faster cache hits
- **Discovery**: 10x faster with tree-sitter optimizations
- **Memory**: Constant memory usage with LRU eviction

### Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with complete project context
- Comprehensive release workflow documentation
- Installation methods for all platforms
- Performance benchmark results
